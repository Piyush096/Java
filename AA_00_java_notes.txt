*public class AA_01_hello world
{ 
  public static void main(string arg[])
  {
    System.out.println("hello world");
  }  
}


*here in this program using println java will put a new line at the end but in case of print new line will not added .

*public static void main(string arg[]) :- a java program begins execution by calling main().here void simply tells the complier that main()     does not return a value .
                                           
* java is case sensitive       

*public class AA_02_SUM
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int i = 10;
        int j = 20;

        int k = i + j;
        System.out.println(k);

    }
}                                      

*java requries that variavles be declares before they are used 
  general form of a variable declaration - type var-name;
  here the types specifies the type of variable being declared.

# DATA TYLPES :-

java defines eight primitive types(simple types) of data:-  Int, Char, Float, Boolean.
 the general form of finding unsigned range :- -2^n-1 to (2^n-1)-1 , wherwe n = size of width of data type in bits . 


1) intiger types :-

java defines four intiger typrs :- bytes , short , int , & long . all these are signed , positive , and negative values.
*java does not support unsigned(non-negative) , positive only integer.

*BYTES :-

the smallest integer type is byte . this is one of byte(8 bit) and has range from -128 to 127.
useful when we working with a stream of data from a network or files.

*SHORT:-

short is a signed 2 bytes (16 bits) type , it has a range from -32,768 to 32,767.
it has probably the least used java type.

*INT :-

it is a signed 4 byte (32 bit) type that has a range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 .
variable of type int are commonly employed to control loops and to index.

*LONG :-

long is a signed 8 bytes (64 bits) type and is useful for those occasions where an int type is not large enough to hold the desired value .
the range of a long is quite large .
 
2) FLOATING TYPES :-

*floating point numbers , also known as real numbers.

*FLOAT:-
float is a 4 byte(32 bits) type that has range from 1.4e-045 to 3.4e+038 variable of type float are useful when we need fractional component .

*DOUBLE:-
double is a 8 bytes(64 bits) type that has range from 4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308 
all the transcendental math , as sin(),cos(),.....return double values . when we need to maintain accuracy over many itertative calculations .

3) CHARACTERS :-
*
* a key point to understand is that java uses unicode to represent characters .
